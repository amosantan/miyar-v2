## ✅ Phase 1 — Audit & Connect · `a6da478`

### What This Unlocked for the Investor

Before this phase, the `material_constants` table existed in PlanetScale with real UAE AED/m² prices — but **nothing in the app ever used it**. The investor had no way to see material-level cost breakdowns.

### What Was Built

| Component | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| `getMaterialConstants()` DB function | Makes 9 seeded material types queryable (stone, glass, steel, aluminum, concrete, ceramic, wood, paint, insulation) |
| `design.getMaterialConstants` tRPC endpoint | Frontend can now display UAE market prices per material |
| `design.calculateSpec` mutation | Input: material type + area → Output: total cost AED, total CO₂, sustainability grade (A–E), maintenance factor |

### Investor Outcome
> Investor can now see **what specific materials cost in the UAE market** and get an instant sustainability grade for any material mix — in seconds, without hiring a quantity surveyor.

---

## ✅ Phase 2 — Investor Dashboard · `a6da478`

### What This Built for the Investor

The **Investor Summary page** (`/projects/:id/investor-summary`) — the central product output. A professional, board-presentable view of a project's full design and financial intelligence.

### Sections

| Section | Investor Value |
|---------|----------------|
| **A · Design Identity** | Confirms typology, style, tier, executive summary - the narrative investors present to boards |
| **B · Material Specification** | Line-by-line material list from AI recommendations + AED/m² reference table (so investors can validate supplier quotes) |
| **C · Budget Synthesis** | Total fitout budget, cost/sqm, visual budget bar chart by room — the key number investors need |
| **D · ROI Bridge** | Sustainability grade + premium sale uplift estimate — the answer to "what does this design investment return?" |

### Investor Outcome
> An investor who enters 6 parameters (typology, GFA, tier, style, location, horizon) can now walk into a board meeting with a structured, branded summary that answers: **how much does this fitout cost, and what does it earn back?**

---

## ✅ Phase 3 — Brief → Numbers · `ca40d00`

### What This Built for the Investor

Connected the **AI design brief** to real AED costs. Before this, the 7-section brief was text only. Now every brief carries `pricingAnalytics` — a structured cost envelope derived from UAE market constants.

Added the **Brief Editor** — an interactive material cost calculator where investors can adjust their material mix and see costs recalculate in real time.

### What Was Built

| Component | Investor Value |
|-----------|----------------|
| `PricingAnalytics` in design brief | Every brief now includes: total fitout AED, cost/sqm avg, carbon kg CO₂, sustainability grade A–E, design premium AED |
| `BriefEditor.tsx` | 9 material toggles + area sliders → live cost/carbon/grade recalc via tRPC mutation |
| ROI Bridge mini-panel | Shows maintenance indicator, sustainability grade, sales premium — positioned right next to the cost tool |
| Market Constants sidebar | UAE AED/m² reference table always visible while the investor is working through costs |

### Investor Outcome
> An investor can now **stress-test their material budget** interactively — toggle from "Italian marble" to "engineered stone," watch the cost and sustainability grade update live, and understand the trade-off before talking to any contractor.

---

## ✅ Phase 4 — Market Grounding · `6278c62`

### What This Built for the Investor

Connected three live UAE market data sources into the product workflow:
1. **Design Trends** → injected directly into Gemini AI prompts so every recommendation reflects current UAE market direction
2. **Benchmark Data** → overlaid on cost estimates so the investor knows exactly how their budget compares to the market
3. **Source Registry** → surfaces where all intelligence comes from, giving the data defensibility for board presentations

### What Was Built

| Component | Investor Value |
|-----------|----------------|
| Design trends → Gemini prompt injection | AI recommendations now reference "established UAE trends" (e.g., organic minimalism, biophilic design) rather than generic global aesthetics |
| Benchmark Overlay in BriefEditor | Shows Low/Mid/High AED/sqm from `benchmarkData` alongside the investor's working estimate — with a live ✓/↑ indicator |
| Section E — Market Intelligence in InvestorSummary | UAE Design Trends grid (confidence-coded: established/emerging/declining) + Market Data Sources panel with reliability grades (A/B/C) |

### Investor Outcome
> An investor can now confidently answer **"is my budget in line with the market?"** and **"are my material choices on-trend for this tier?"** — both backed by traceable UAE data sources they can name to a board.

---

## ✅ Phase 5 — Export & Handover · `296f743`

### What This Built for the Investor

Closed the loop from insight to **deliverable**. Three export modes now exist, matching how luxury real estate deals actually move (emails, board packs, investor forwards).

### What Was Built

| Component | Investor Value |
|-----------|----------------|
| `investor-pdf.ts` HTML PDF engine | Professional A4 investor brief (Cover + 5 sections) — equivalent to a consultant's deliverable, generated in seconds |
| `design.exportInvestorPdf` tRPC endpoint | One click → printable HTML opens in new tab → Print as PDF |
| `design.createShareLink` + `resolveShareLink` | Generates a 7-day, token-gated link to the investor brief — no login required for recipients |
| `ShareView.tsx` — `/share/:token` | Recipients see a branded, read-only version of the investor brief |
| Export DOCX button | Existing Word document export (6-section design brief) |
| Share Link button | Creates and copies the public URL in one click |

### Investor Outcome
> After completing a project analysis, the investor clicks **"Share Link"** and forwards a URL to their board, their client, or their JV partner. The recipient sees a professional, watermarked investor brief — without needing a MIYAR account. The investor looks like they hired a consulting firm. **It took 60 seconds total.**

| Dashboard, BriefEditor, InvestorSummary | Freshness badges visible everywhere market data is shown |

**Freshness indicators:**
- 🟢 **Fresh** — within expected cadence
- 🟡 **Stale** — overdue 1–2x cadence
- 🔴 **Expired** — may be unreliable

### Investor Outcome
> Every single cost number is now **clickable** — the investor can trace it from AED/m² all the way back to the original data source, see its reliability grade, and check when it was last verified. This is the level of provenance that **lenders and institutional investors** require.

---

## ✅ Phase B — Infrastructure for Live Data

> **Goal:** Real-time market data pipeline — DLD transactions, automated ingestion, connector health monitoring.

### B.1 · Vercel Cron Scheduler · `1da390a`

  → Multiplier Engine → 1.00–1.15 cost premium
    → Normalization → adjusted expected cost
      → Budget Fit recalculated
        → Scoring: DS boost + ER certRisk
          → P6 penalty if budget < cert requirement
```

**Certification cost premiums:**

| Tier | Premium |
|------|---------|
| Bronze / Al Sa'fat | +0% |
| Silver / Silver Visa | +3–5% |
| Gold / Golden Visa | +6–10% |
| Platinum | +10–15% |

### Investor Outcome
> An investor in Abu Dhabi building an Estidama Gold project now sees **exactly how that certification target affects their budget** — the 8% premium is baked into every cost estimate, the scoring engine rewards the higher sustainability target, and compliance gaps are auto-identified with actionable remediation steps. For institutional clients, the **public methodology page** proves the numbers are defensible.

---

## ✅ Phase E — Scale Features

And for institutional clients working with RICS-certified QS firms, every material cost carries an **NRM element code** that matches industry-standard cost plans.

---

## ✅ Phase 6 — Deep Analytics & Scope Refinement · `8c65d35`

### What This Built for the Investor

Shifted MIYAR from standard estimation to a **Deep Analytics Engine** capable of understanding real-world strategic and execution nuances (like timeline rigidity, brand standards, and asset lifecycle goals).

### What Was Built

| Component | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| **7 Strategic Variables** | Added `handoverCondition`, `brandedStatus`, `salesChannel`, `lifecycleFocus`, `brandStandardConstraints`, `timelineFlexibility`, `targetValueAdd` to deeply profile the investment. |
| **Compounding Multipliers** | Created dynamic cost adjustments in `normalization.ts` (e.g., penalties for fixed 0-tolerance timelines, premiums for high-OPEX lifecycles). |
| **Advanced MIYAR Scoring** | Adjusted `scoring.ts` to penalize Strategic Alignment (SA) and Execution Risk (ER) if the budget violates the timeline/brand constraints. |
| **Outcome Prediction** | Refined the Monte Carlo comparables engine (`outcome-prediction.ts`) so MIYAR seeks historical comps matching the exact strategic profile before filtering by region. |

### Investor Outcome
> An investor's ROI calculation now explicitly factors in the **hidden costs of execution** (e.g., expedited shipping for zero-tolerance schedules, or premium materials dictated by strict brand lists), resulting in the most robust and defensible feasibility score in the market.
