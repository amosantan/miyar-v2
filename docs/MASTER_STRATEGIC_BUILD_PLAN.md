# MASTER STRATEGIC BUILD PLAN — MIYAR PLATFORM

**Instruction Type:** Knowledge Alignment Only — Do Not Execute  
**Purpose:** Full system development roadmap and architectural intent  
**Execution:** Phase-by-phase prompts will be issued separately  
**Reporting:** Every execution phase will require a detailed Phase Reality Report  

---

## 1. CURRENT SYSTEM POSITION (BASELINE)

### Core Functional Layer (Built)
- Structured project intake workflow
- Deterministic multi-criteria scoring engine
- Scenario simulation engine
- ROI and cost evaluation logic
- Admin control and benchmark registry
- Report generation (structured outputs)
- Validation framework and governance controls

### Intelligence Foundation (Built)
- Data structures for benchmark storage
- Model governance mechanisms
- Version control capability
- Scenario comparison logic

### What the system does NOT yet fully do
- Generate full executable interior design briefs
- Ingest live market intelligence
- Continuously update cost benchmarks from evidence
- Analyze competitor projects structurally
- Detect market trend signals
- Learn from real project outcomes
- Provide design material boards or visual synthesis
- Operate as a full decision-to-design translation platform

## 2. FINAL TARGET STATE

**MIYAR must become:** A Decision-Intelligence Operating System for Real Estate Interior Development

---

## 3. MASTER DEVELOPMENT ARCHITECTURE (4 Macro Layers)

| Layer | Purpose | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **A — Core Decision Engine** | Deterministic evaluation and scoring | Completed foundation |
| **B — Market Intelligence Layer** | External reality ingestion (price, suppliers, competitors, trends) | Next major build |
| **C — Design Translation Layer** | Convert validated strategy into executable design documentation | Planned |
| **D — Adaptive Learning & Strategic Intelligence** | Long-term system evolution | Planned |

---

## 4. EXECUTION STAGES (7 Stages)

| Stage | Name | Key Outcome |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Market Intelligence Layer V1 | System understands market reality |
| 2 | Benchmark Governance Expansion | Benchmarks become dynamic but controlled |
| 3 | Competitor Intelligence Engine | Developers see real positioning context |
| 4 | Design Brief Generation Engine | MIYAR becomes operationally useful to designers |
| 5 | Visual & Material Intelligence | Design direction becomes tangible |
| 6 | Outcome Learning Engine | System evolves from evidence |
| 7 | Portfolio & Strategic Intelligence | MIYAR becomes strategic planning platform |

---

## 5. DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES (MANDATORY)

1. Deterministic scoring remains primary decision engine
2. AI outputs are evidence inputs, not decision authority
3. All benchmark changes require approval workflow
4. All external data must be traceable to source
5. No automatic learning without validation
6. Every module must produce audit logs
7. System explainability must be preserved

---

## 6. PHASE DELIVERY STRUCTURE

Each phase must deliver: module build, architecture details, database schema, API structure, governance rules, validation logic, interface behaviour, integration mapping.

Each phase must end with a **Phase Reality Report** containing:
1. What was built
2. Architecture diagrams
3. Database tables
4. Algorithms implemented
5. Interfaces created
6. Integration status
7. Limitations
8. Validation results
9. Next technical risks
