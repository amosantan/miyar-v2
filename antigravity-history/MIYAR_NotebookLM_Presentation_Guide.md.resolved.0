# MIYAR App - NotebookLM Presentation Guide

Since NotebookLM works best when provided with structured context, follow these steps to generate a professional presentation (or an Audio Overview) on **How to Use the MIYAR App** using your project files.

## Step 1: Create the NotebookLM Project
1. Go to [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/).
2. Click **New Notebook**.
3. Name it **"MIYAR Decision Intelligence Platform - Training & Presentation"**.

## Step 2: Upload Source Documents
To give NotebookLM the most accurate understanding of MIYAR, upload the following markdown documents from your local `artifacts` folder:

1. [master_plan_gap_analysis.md](file:///Users/amrosaleh/.gemini/antigravity/brain/7c19b7ce-bcbf-4927-9935-14273b999ad2/master_plan_gap_analysis.md) (Provides the overall vision and capabilities)
2. [v9_phase_reality_report.md](file:///Users/amrosaleh/.gemini/antigravity/brain/7c19b7ce-bcbf-4927-9935-14273b999ad2/v9_phase_reality_report.md) (Explains the strategic intelligence and economic modeling features)
3. [v8_phase_reality_report.md](file:///Users/amrosaleh/.gemini/antigravity/brain/7c19b7ce-bcbf-4927-9935-14273b999ad2/v8_phase_reality_report.md) (Explains the evaluation engine and score matrix)
4. [v7_phase_reality_report.md](file:///Users/amrosaleh/.gemini/antigravity/brain/7c19b7ce-bcbf-4927-9935-14273b999ad2/v7_phase_reality_report.md) (Explains the report generation features)
5. `DFE_Reality_Report_Handover.md` (Explains the data ingestion and market intelligence)
6. [future_phases_roadmap.md](file:///Users/amrosaleh/.gemini/antigravity/brain/7c19b7ce-bcbf-4927-9935-14273b999ad2/future_phases_roadmap.md) (Provides the forward-looking roadmap for context)

*Note: You can simply drag and drop these [.md](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/.agent/workflows/db-migrate.md) files directly into the NotebookLM source panel.*

## Step 3: Use This Prompt to Generate the Presentation
Once the sources are uploaded, copy and paste the following prompt into the NotebookLM chat box:

> **PROMPT:**
> "Act as a Senior Product Marketing Manager for 'MIYAR', a Decision Intelligence Platform for real estate developers. Based on the uploaded documentation, create a highly professional, slide-by-slide presentation titled 'How to Use the MIYAR Platform'. 
> 
> The intended audience is real estate executives, development directors, and investment managers. The presentation should be persuasive, clear, and focus on practical workflows.
> 
> For each slide, please provide:
> 1. **Slide Title:** A strong, action-oriented title.
> 2. **Key Message (The 'Why'):** One sentence summarizing the slide's core value.
> 3. **Talking Points (The 'How'):** 3-4 bullet points explaining what the user actually does in the app (e.g., 'Upload the architectural brief', 'Adjust the budget parameters', 'Run the Evaluation Engine').
> 4. **Visual Suggestion:** A brief description of what should be shown on the screen (e.g., 'Screenshot of the Project Dashboard showing the Risk vs. Alignment score').
> 
> Please structure the presentation as follows:
> - **Slide 1-2:** Introduction & The MIYAR Advantage (What it is and why it matters).
> - **Slide 3:** Step 1: Ingesting Market Intelligence (DFE).
> - **Slide 4:** Step 2: Creating a Project & Setting Parameters.
> - **Slide 5:** Step 3: Running the AI Evaluation & Scoring Engine.
> - **Slide 6:** Step 4: Strategic & Economic Modeling (Scenario planning & ROI).
> - **Slide 7:** Step 5: Generating Output Reports & Material Boards.
> - **Slide 8:** Summary & Next Steps.
> 
> Keep the tone authoritative, innovative, and focused on risk-reduction and ROI maximization."

## Step 4 (Optional): Generate an Audio Overview
After generating the written presentation, you can also use NotebookLM's **Audio Overview** feature to generate a Deep Dive podcast automatically. 
- Click on the **"Audio Overview"** play button at the top right of your sources panel.
- The AI hosts will naturally discuss the MIYAR platform, its workflow, and its value proposition based on the uploaded V1-V9 documentation. It serves as an excellent audio companion for training new users or stakeholders!
