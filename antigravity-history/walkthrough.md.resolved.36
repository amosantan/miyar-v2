## Phase A.3 — Evidence Chain Click-Through

### What Was Built

**Goal:** Let investors click any cost number and trace it back to a named, dated, graded source.

| Layer | File | What |
|-------|------|------|
| DB | [db.ts](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/db.ts) | [getEvidenceWithSources()](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/db.ts#2172-2220) — JOIN evidence_records + source_registry |
| API | [design.ts](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/routers/design.ts) | `design.getEvidenceChain` query endpoint |
| Component | [EvidenceChainDrawer.tsx](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/client/src/components/EvidenceChainDrawer.tsx) | 230-line slide-out Sheet with full provenance cards |
| Integration | [BriefEditor.tsx](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/client/src/pages/BriefEditor.tsx) | 📎 on every AED/m² badge |
| Integration | [InvestorSummary.tsx](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/client/src/pages/InvestorSummary.tsx) | "📎 View Evidence Chain" on Section B header |

### Each Evidence Card Shows

1. **Item name** + spec class
2. **Reliability grade** badge (A = green, B = amber, C = red)
3. **Price range grid**: Low / Typical / High in AED
4. **Extracted evidence snippet** (the raw text from the source)
5. **Source provenance**: name, type, URL link, freshness indicator
6. **Record ID + capture date**

### Verification

- `vite build` ✅ (6.06s)
- Pushed to main `37ff78b`

## Key Audit Finding

**Phase A.1 (Ask MIYAR NL Query) and A.2 (Stress Test Visualization) were already fully built.** The Dashboard has a working search bar wired to [nl-engine.ts](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/engines/autonomous/nl-engine.ts) (Text→SQL→Execute→Interpret pipeline), and the Scenarios page has stress test mutations with resilience scores. Both were skipped as already complete.

## Next Steps

- **Phase A.4:** Data Freshness Badges — surface `connector_health` timestamps across data-driven pages
- **Phase B.1:** Deploy scheduler as persistent worker (not Vercel)
- **Phase B.2:** DLD (Dubai Pulse) API connector
