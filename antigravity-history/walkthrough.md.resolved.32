# Design Intelligence Engine — Phase 1 & 2 Walkthrough

## Phase 1 Audit — What We Found

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| `designRouter` in [server/routers.ts](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/routers.ts) | ✅ Registered correctly |
| `designAdvisorRouter` in [server/routers.ts](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/routers.ts) | ✅ Registered correctly |
| [DesignBrief](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/drizzle/schema.ts#533-534), [DesignAdvisor](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/client/src/pages/DesignAdvisor.tsx#621-628), `DesignStudio` pages | ✅ Routed in [App.tsx](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/client/src/App.tsx) |
| `pricing-engine.ts` | ✅ Real (reads live benchmark proposals from DB) |
| `nano-banana-client.ts` | ✅ Real (calls Gemini image API) |
| `design-brief.ts` engine | ✅ Real (generates 7-section structured briefs) |
| `material_constants` table | ❌ **SEEDED IN DB BUT NEVER QUERIED** — gap fixed below |

## Phase 1 Fix — `material_constants` Bridge

**Problem:** The `material_constants` table (9 materials, real AED/m² prices, carbon intensity, maintenance factors) existed in PlanetScale but was never imported or queried by any server code.

**Fixes applied:**

### [server/db.ts](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/db.ts)
- Added `materialConstants` to the Drizzle import block
- Added [getMaterialConstants()](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/db.ts#2066-2072) — returns all seeded material constants ordered by type
- Added [getMaterialConstantByType(materialType)](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/db.ts#2073-2082) — lookup by material name

### [server/routers/design.ts](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/routers/design.ts)
- Added `design.getMaterialConstants` — query endpoint for frontend consumption
- Added `design.calculateSpec` — full cost/carbon/maintenance/sustainability calculator:
  - Input: `[{ materialType, areaM2 }]` array
  - Output: `totalCostAed`, `totalCarbonKg`, `avgMaintenanceFactor`, `sustainabilityGrade (A–E)`, `costPerM2Avg`, per-line `breakdown[]`
  - Matches materialType strings against the `material_constants` table; unknown types are skipped gracefully

## Phase 2 — Investor Dashboard

### New file: [client/src/pages/InvestorSummary.tsx](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/client/src/pages/InvestorSummary.tsx)

The missing "investor-facing view" — a unified 4-section page that synthesizes data from design brief, space recommendations, and material constants:

| Section | What it shows |
|---------|---------------|
| **A · Design Identity** | Typology, style, market tier, location + executive summary + design direction JSON |
| **B · Material Specification** | Full material list from space recommendations + UAE market AED/m² reference table from `material_constants` |
| **C · Budget Synthesis** | Total fitout budget, $/sqm, spaces covered + bar chart of budget allocation by space |
| **D · ROI Bridge** | Sustainability grade, maintenance indicator, sales premium estimate (tier-based), net uplift calculation |

### Route: [App.tsx](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/client/src/App.tsx)
Added: `/projects/:id/investor-summary` → [InvestorSummary](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/client/src/pages/InvestorSummary.tsx#402-409) (protected)

### Navigation: [ProjectDetail.tsx](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/client/src/pages/ProjectDetail.tsx)
Added **"Investor View"** button (violet) in the project header, next to the AI Design Advisor button.

## TypeScript Status

All lint errors resolved:
- Removed non-existent `design.getRfqLines` call
- Added explicit types to all implicit `any` callback parameters
- Fixed `Record<string, number>` index lookup for tier premium
- Added `Building2` to lucide-react imports in [ProjectDetail.tsx](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/client/src/pages/ProjectDetail.tsx)

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

- Brief → Numbers: connect [DesignBrief.tsx](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/client/src/pages/DesignBrief.tsx) to `design.calculateSpec` so material selections trigger real-time cost recalculation
- Add `listRfqLines` endpoint to expose RFQ line items on the Investor Summary budget section
- Phase 4: Market grounding (link trend tags to design direction)
