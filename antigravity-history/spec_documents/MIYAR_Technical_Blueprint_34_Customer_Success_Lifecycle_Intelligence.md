MIYAR Technical Blueprint 34
 Customer Success Lifecycle & Value Realisation
Intelligence Framework
1. Strategic Purpose
This framework defines how MIYAR manages client value delivery after acquisition. It governs onboarding,
engagement monitoring, satisfaction tracking, repeat conversion, and long■term economic value expansion. The
objective is to ensure measurable impact per project and predictable lifetime value per developer account.
2. Customer Lifecycle Architecture

4. Client Health Scoring Logic
Client Health Score (0–100) is computed from weighted behavioural indicators:
H = w1(U) + w2(V) + w3(R) + w4(S) + w5(E)
Where:
U = Usage intensity
V = Realised value metrics
R = Repeat engagement frequency
S = Satisfaction signals
E = Expansion readiness
Health thresholds:
80–100 = Strategic account
60–79 = Stable account
40–59 = At■risk account
0–39 = Critical intervention required
5. Automated Intervention Triggers

Optimization recommendation
Strategy call
Delayed project cycle
Timeline deviation
Process diagnostic report
Client consultation
Declining satisfaction
Feedback sentiment drop
Escalation workflow
Senior review
Expansion opportunity
High health + repeat pattern
Portfolio module proposal

6. Feedback Intelligence Loop
Feedback is processed across three channels:
1. Explicit client feedback (ratings, comments)
2. Behavioural signals (usage patterns, delays, rework frequency)
3. Outcome variance (predicted vs realised project outcomes)
All signals feed the continuous improvement engine and update:
 - decision rules
 - benchmark ranges
 - reporting clarity models
7. Customer Success Reporting Cadence

8. Governance Outcomes
This system ensures that every MIYAR deployment produces measurable economic and operational impact. It
institutionalises client value monitoring, enables predictive retention management, and transforms customer
relationships into structured long■term strategic partnerships.
