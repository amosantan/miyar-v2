MIYAR Technical Blueprint 13
 Validation Methodology Handbook
1. Purpose of the Validation Methodology
This handbook defines the formal decision-validation doctrine used by the MIYAR system. It
transforms subjective development intuition into a structured, repeatable, and auditable evaluation
process. The methodology standardises how interior design directions are assessed across four
dimensions:  Strategic alignment  Financial feasibility  Market positioning  Execution risk The
objective is not design generation but decision integrity verification.
2. Core Validation Philosophy
MIYAR validation follows five governing principles: 1. Neutrality — No aesthetic preference is
embedded. 2. Structured comparison — All alternatives are evaluated under identical criteria. 3.
Quantified judgment — Qualitative inputs are converted into measurable indicators. 4. Probabilistic
evaluation — Outcomes are expressed as likelihood ranges, not certainties. 5. Traceable reasoning
— Every score must be explainable and reproducible.
3. Validation Dimensions
Dimension
Purpose
Primary Indicators
Strategic Alignment
Consistency with project vision
Target segment fit, brand positioning, differentiation
Financial Feasibility
Budget realism and cost exposure
Material cost, lifecycle cost, variance tolerance
Market Positioning
Commercial attractiveness
Demand fit, competitive uniqueness, buyer expectations
Execution Risk
Delivery complexity
Supply chain risk, constructability, technical dependency
4. Variable Classification Model
All input variables are classified into three structural layers: Layer 1 — Project Constraints
Immutable conditions such as budget, location, regulatory environment. Layer 2 — Strategic Intent
Developer vision, positioning goals, differentiation ambition. Layer 3 — Design Characteristics
Material systems, spatial qualities, experiential attributes. Validation measures compatibility across
layers.
5. Weight Allocation Logic
Each validation dimension receives dynamic weighting based on project typology. Example
weighting structure:  Luxury residential: Market positioning dominant  Mid-market housing:
Financial feasibility dominant  Branded development: Strategic alignment dominant Weight values
are normalised to sum to 1.0.

6. Compatibility Scoring Mechanism
Each design decision is evaluated through pairwise compatibility checks: Vision ↔ Market Vision ↔
Budget Design ↔ Execution Design ↔ Positioning Compatibility scores range 0–100. Scores
below threshold trigger risk flags.
7. Risk Classification Logic
Risk is computed from three factors:  Magnitude of misalignment  Probability of impact  Recovery
difficulty Risk Score = Severity × Probability × Recovery Complexity Risk levels: Low < 20 Moderate
20–50 High > 50
8. Scenario Comparison Model
When multiple design directions exist, MIYAR performs scenario dominance analysis. Each
scenario is evaluated across identical variables. Dominance is determined through:  Weighted
composite score  Risk-adjusted score  Stability margin A scenario may be superior in score but
inferior in stability.
9. Decision Stability Index
Measures sensitivity of results to input variation. Stability Index = 1 − (Score Variance / Maximum
Possible Variance) High stability indicates robust decision confidence.
10. Benchmark Integration
Historical project outcomes recalibrate evaluation thresholds. Benchmark use cases:  Expected
cost ranges  Market acceptance patterns  Risk frequency  Decision reversals Benchmarks
continuously update weight calibration.
11. Validation Output Interpretation Framework
Outputs are interpreted through four reporting lenses: 1. Alignment confirmation 2. Risk exposure
map 3. Financial realism band 4. Decision confidence level The system does not prescribe design
selection — it validates viability envelope.
12. Governance and Version Control
Validation logic is versioned. Each model update records:  Parameter changes  Weight
adjustments  Benchmark recalibration  Performance impact Ensures auditability and
methodological transparency.
13. Methodological Boundaries
The validation framework does not:  Replace professional design judgment  Guarantee
commercial success  Predict subjective aesthetic preference  Substitute regulatory approval It
evaluates structural coherence only.
