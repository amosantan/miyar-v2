MIYAR Technical Blueprint 27
 Strategic Capital Allocation & Scenario Planning
Engine
1. System Purpose
This module defines the strategic capital allocation and financial scenario planning engine within
the MIYAR platform. The objective is to evaluate how interior positioning decisions influence capital
distribution, cost exposure, return potential, and risk concentration across development projects.
The engine enables structured simulation of alternative investment strategies prior to commitment,
supporting evidence-based financial planning at both project and portfolio levels.

This engine transforms MIYAR from a validation framework into a financial decision intelligence
platform. It enables developers to understand the capital consequences of interior positioning
choices before investment is committed, improving financial discipline and strategic planning
precision.
