MIYAR Technical Blueprint — Part 4
Output Architecture, Reporting Engine, and User Interface Logic
1. Output System Purpose
The MIYAR output system converts computational validation results into structured decision
artifacts that can be interpreted, communicated, and operationally applied within real estate
development workflows. Outputs must satisfy five operational requirements:  Decision clarity —
eliminate ambiguity regarding direction viability  Diagnostic transparency — explain why a direction
is or is not valid  Implementation readiness — provide structured briefing intelligence  Financial
interpretability — connect positioning to cost structure  Communication usability — usable by
non-technical stakeholders Outputs are not visualizations alone. They are formal decision
instruments.

4. Validation Classification Framework
Status
Composite Score Range
Interpretation
Required Action
Validated
≥ Threshold
Direction structurally viable
Proceed to design briefing
Conditionally Validated
Near threshold
Requires parameter adjustment
Refine constraints
Not Validated
< Threshold
Structural misalignment present
Reconfigure direction
High Risk Validated
Valid but unstable
Sensitive to small changes
Monitor closely
5. Dimension Score Reporting Model
Each evaluation dimension is presented with:  raw score  weighted contribution  penalty
adjustment  sensitivity level  interpretive explanation Dimension reporting ensures that validation
outcomes are explainable and traceable.
6. Risk Concentration Mapping


Risk mapping identifies structural fragility within the evaluated direction. Risk drivers include: 
budget constraint tension  market positioning mismatch  differentiation overreach  execution
complexity concentration Risk severity levels: Low → Moderate → Elevated → Critical
Risk Level
Meaning
Decision Implication
Low
Stable under variation
Proceed normally
Moderate
Localized vulnerability
Monitor variable
Elevated
Multi-variable sensitivity
Mitigation required
Critical
Structural instability
Reconfigure direction
7. Scenario Comparison Output
Scenario reporting compares baseline direction performance against controlled constraint variation.
Comparison metrics:  composite score change  dimension shift magnitude  validation status
change  sensitivity ranking Scenarios are presented as structured comparative tables, not narrative
descriptions.

11. Report Generation Logic
Report generation is template-driven and deterministic. Generation sequence: 1. Retrieve
evaluation dataset 2. Compute summary statistics 3. Generate classification result 4. Compile
dimension diagnostics 5. Insert scenario comparison 6. Generate implementation guidance 7.
Format export document
12. Output Integrity Rules


All outputs must be:  reproducible  traceable to input variables  consistent across format types 
free of non-deterministic interpretation No narrative recommendation may contradict computed
results.
