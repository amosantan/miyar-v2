 Digital Twin Interior Design Simulation
Environment
1. System Purpose
This module defines the Digital Twin Simulation Environment of the MIYAR platform. The objective
is to create a computational representation of proposed interior strategies within a virtualized
spatial, financial, and behavioral environment. The system enables predictive simulation of design
performance before physical execution, allowing developers to test outcomes under multiple
realistic operating conditions. This transforms validation from static evaluation into dynamic
scenario experimentation.
