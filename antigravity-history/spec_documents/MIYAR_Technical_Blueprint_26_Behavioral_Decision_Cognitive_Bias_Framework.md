MIYAR Technical Blueprint 26
 Behavioral Decision Modeling & Cognitive Bias
Detection Framework
1. System Purpose
This module defines the behavioral intelligence layer of the MIYAR platform. Its objective is to
detect, model, and manage cognitive biases that influence early-stage development
decision-making. Real estate developers frequently operate under psychological pressures
including overconfidence, anchoring, loss aversion, and aesthetic preference bias. This framework
introduces structured detection and adjustment mechanisms to ensure that validation outcomes
remain analytically grounded while preserving human strategic intent.
2. Behavioral Signal Detection Inputs
Signal Type
Observed Behavior
Interpretation
Repeated Override
Frequent rejection of model outputs
Potential overconfidence bias
Preference Rigidity
Consistent selection of narrow style range
Anchoring or familiarity bias
Budget Minimization Pattern
Systematic downward cost adjustment
Loss aversion behavior
Delay in Decision Confirmation
Extended hesitation duration
Uncertainty avoidance
Extreme Differentiation Selection
Preference for unconventional design
Novelty-seeking bias
Rapid Acceptance Without Review
Minimal evaluation time
Automation complacency
3. Cognitive Bias Classification Framework
Bias Category
Behavioral Indicator
Decision Risk
Overconfidence Bias
Dismissal of uncertainty indicators
Underestimation of cost escalation
Anchoring Bias
Reliance on initial reference values
Inflexible design positioning
Loss Aversion
Preference for cost minimization
Quality or market mismatch
Status Quo Bias
Resistance to differentiation
Reduced competitive positioning
Availability Bias
Reliance on recent project experience
Misaligned market assumptions
Aesthetic Dominance Bias
Personal taste over market data
Target buyer mismatch
4. Behavioral Detection Logic
1
Capture user interaction patterns across decision sessions
2
Measure deviation between model recommendation and user action
3
Calculate statistical divergence frequency
4
Map divergence patterns to bias classification signatures
5
Assign behavioral confidence score
6
Trigger cognitive risk flag if threshold exceeded
7
Log behavioral profile for longitudinal tracking


5. Bias Mitigation Intervention Model
Intervention Type
System Action
Objective
Decision Reflection Prompt
Require justification entry
Increase awareness
Scenario Comparison Display
Show alternative outcome paths
Encourage evaluation breadth
Risk Amplification Indicator
Highlight uncertainty magnitude
Counter overconfidence
Market Evidence Overlay
Display empirical benchmarks
Reduce subjective dominance
Temporal Delay Trigger
Enforce review period
Prevent impulsive selection
6. Integration into Validation Model
Behavioral risk indicators modify decision confidence scoring rather than core feasibility
calculations. When bias probability exceeds defined thresholds, the system adjusts
recommendation confidence intervals and highlights areas requiring additional verification.
7. Behavioral Intelligence Outputs
Output Component
Description
Bias Probability Index
Likelihood of cognitive influence
Decision Stability Score
Consistency of decision pathway
Behavioral Risk Flags
Alert categories
Intervention Recommendation
Suggested mitigation step
Behavioral Trend Report
Long-term decision pattern analysis
8. Strategic System Role
This framework elevates MIYAR beyond analytical validation by integrating behavioral awareness
into the decision environment. By identifying cognitive bias patterns, the system enhances decision
reliability, improves risk management, and strengthens alignment between analytical insight and
strategic judgment.
