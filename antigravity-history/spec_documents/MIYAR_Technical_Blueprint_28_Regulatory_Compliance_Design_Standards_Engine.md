MIYAR Technical Blueprint 28
 Regulatory Compliance & Design Standards
Intelligence Engine
1. System Purpose
This module defines the regulatory compliance and design standards intelligence engine within the
MIYAR platform. The objective is to ensure that validated interior positioning decisions remain
aligned with applicable regulatory requirements, construction codes, accessibility standards, safety
provisions, and industry design guidelines. The engine provides structured compliance screening at
early decision stages, reducing downstream risk of redesign, approval delays, or specification
conflicts.

8. Strategic System Role
This engine integrates regulatory awareness directly into early-stage design validation. It reduces
compliance risk exposure, improves planning certainty, and enhances coordination between
conceptual design positioning and execution feasibility.
