MIYAR Technical Blueprint 33
 Commercial Operating Model & Revenue Control
Framework
0. Executive Intent
This document defines MIYAR’s commercial mechanics beyond pricing. It specifies how the business controls
revenue quality, manages cost-to-serve, protects margins, governs discounts, and structures partner economics. It
also defines unit economics monitoring and the decision triggers used to scale the business responsibly.
1. Commercial Unit Structure
Commercial Unit
What It Sells
Primary Customer
Primary Success Metric
Project Toolkit Packages
Validation packages (Basic/Pro/Enterprise)
Developers (SME)
Gross margin per project
Portfolio Intelligence
Multi-project analytics + benchmarking
Portfolio operators
Annual recurring revenue (ARR)
Add-On Services
Physical board kit, workshops, procurement-ready RFQ pack
Developers & designers
Contribution margin per add-on
Partner Distribution
Referral / reseller routes
Agencies, PMs, consultants
CAC reduction + conversion rate
API / Integration Access
Data interfaces and automation hooks
Enterprise clients
Retention + stickiness
2. Client Lifecycle Economics
MIYAR commercial control begins with managing the lifecycle economics of each client: acquisition cost, delivery
cost, repeat usage, and long-term value. The platform is designed around repeat-project usage rather than one-time
transactions. The commercial model treats each developer as a multi-project account, with structured up-sell to
portfolio modules.
Stage
Commercial Objective
Key Controls
Primary KPIs
Acquisition

3. Cost-to-Serve Model (CTS)
Cost-to-serve is monitored per project and decomposed into controllable cost drivers. MIYAR applies a CTS cap per
package tier. If CTS exceeds the cap, the system triggers scope reduction, automation substitution, or premium
pricing requirements.

7. Contract Standardisation Logic
Contracts are standardized by tier with controlled annexes. No bespoke scope is allowed without a formal change
order. Core clauses include scope boundaries (non-design), confidentiality, IP usage rights, liability limitations, and
payment terms. All change requests must follow the platform change control workflow.
