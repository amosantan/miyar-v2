MIYAR Technical Blueprint 35
 Strategic Risk Intelligence & Resilience Architecture
1. Strategic Purpose
This document defines the integrated risk intelligence and resilience architecture governing MIYAR’s
decision-support platform. It establishes structured mechanisms for identifying, modelling, monitoring, and
mitigating operational, commercial, technological, behavioural, and strategic risks across the full product lifecycle.
The objective is not merely risk control, but predictive resilience and adaptive stability.
2. Multi-Domain Risk Taxonomy
Risk Domain
Definition
Primary Exposure Vector
System Monitoring Method
Model Risk

Compliance rule engine
3. Integrated Risk Scoring Model
Each risk is evaluated using composite scoring:
R = (P × I × V) / C
Where:
P = Probability of occurrence
I = Impact magnitude
V = System vulnerability level
C = Control strength
Normalized scale: 0–100
Risk bands:
0–20 = Minimal
21–40 = Controlled
41–60 = Elevated
61–80 = Critical
81–100 = Systemic threat
4. Risk Response Strategy Matrix

Layer 4 — Commercial Resilience
   Margin buffers, diversified revenue channels
Layer 5 — Strategic Resilience
   Market intelligence adaptation, roadmap adjustment
7. Scenario Stress Testing Framework

8. Risk Governance Cycle
Continuous monitoring → risk detection → severity scoring → response selection →
intervention execution → outcome measurement → control refinement → baseline update
9. Strategic Outcome
The MIYAR risk intelligence system transforms uncertainty into measurable and controllable variables. It ensures
platform stability, protects economic performance, and enables adaptive evolution under changing market and
operational conditions.
