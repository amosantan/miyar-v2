MIYAR Technical Blueprint 20
 Explainability, Auditability, and Decision
Transparency Framework
This document defines the full explainability and auditability architecture for the MIYAR
decision-support system. The objective is to ensure that every validation outcome generated by the
platform is traceable, interpretable, reproducible, and defensible across technical, operational, and
commercial contexts. Explainability is treated as a core product function rather than an auxiliary
feature. The system is designed so that each recommendation, score, or validation result can be
decomposed into contributing variables, weighting logic, constraint interactions, and comparative
benchmarks.
1. Explainability Objectives
1
Provide transparent reasoning for every score and recommendation
2
Enable users to understand trade-offs between design variables
3
Support internal review and expert override capability
4
Maintain regulatory and contractual defensibility
5
Enable longitudinal learning and model governance
6
Allow reproducibility of historical decisions
2. Decision Traceability Model
Every system output is generated through a structured decision chain composed of: (1) input data
normalization, (2) variable weighting, (3) constraint evaluation, (4) compatibility scoring, (5)
benchmark comparison, (6) synthesis logic, (7) report generation. Each stage produces a
machine-readable trace record stored in the Decision Ledger.

3. Variable Contribution Analysis
Each output score is decomposed into variable-level contribution weights. The system generates a
ranked influence map showing how each variable affected the final decision outcome. This allows
users to identify dominant drivers, sensitivity relationships, and potential adjustment levers.

4. Scenario Simulation Transparency
The system records all scenario simulations executed during validation. Each alternative
configuration is stored with full parameter sets and resulting scores. Users can review comparison
matrices to understand why one option outperformed another.
5. Audit Trail Architecture
1
Immutable decision logs
2
Versioned model parameters
3
Timestamped execution history
4
User interaction records
5
Override justification capture
6
Reproducibility engine


6. Expert Override Governance
Authorized experts may override system recommendations. All overrides require structured
justification fields, impact classification, and approval routing. Overrides are tracked to improve
future model calibration.
7. Model Transparency Layers
1
User-level explanation (plain language)
2
Technical decomposition (variable weights)
3
Statistical diagnostics
4
Comparative benchmark reference
5
Historical performance context


8. Reporting Integration
Explainability outputs are embedded directly within validation reports. Each recommendation
includes:  confidence score  reasoning summary  variable impact chart  scenario comparison 
risk flags  sensitivity analysis
9. Compliance and Governance Alignment
The explainability framework supports contractual transparency, professional defensibility, and
internal quality assurance. Decision logic documentation can be exported for regulatory, legal, or
client review when required.


10. Future Expansion
1
Automated decision narrative generation
2
AI-assisted explanation synthesis
3
Cross-project pattern detection
4
Self-calibrating weighting logic
5
Benchmark explainability dashboards
