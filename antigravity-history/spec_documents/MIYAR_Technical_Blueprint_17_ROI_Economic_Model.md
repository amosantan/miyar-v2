MIYAR Technical Blueprint 17 ROI Computation &
Economic Impact Modeling Framework
1. Purpose of the Economic Model
This document defines the complete economic impact modeling system used by MIYAR to quantify
financial value delivered to real estate developers through early-stage interior validation. The model
converts design decision clarity into measurable financial outcomes including cost avoidance, time
compression, procurement efficiency, and market positioning improvement. The framework exists
for three operational purposes:  Client-facing ROI reporting  Internal product value measurement 
Continuous model calibration using real project outcomes The model operates across pre-design,
design, and pre-construction phases and evaluates financial consequences of decision timing,
design stability, and specification alignment.
2. Core Economic Value Drivers
MIYAR measures value across five primary financial impact domains: 1. Design Rework Avoidance
2. Procurement Efficiency 3. Programme Acceleration 4. Specification Optimization 5. Market
Positioning Impact Each domain is quantified using baseline industry variance assumptions
combined with project-specific input parameters.
3. ROI Calculation Structure
ROI is computed using a structured multi-component model: Total Value Created = (Rework Cost
Avoided) + (Procurement Savings) + (Time Value Gain) + (Specification Efficiency Gain) +
(Positioning Premium Protection) Net ROI = (Total Value Created – MIYAR Service Fee) / MIYAR
Service Fee All values are normalized to project scale using gross development value (GDV),
interior package value, and construction timeline.
4. Cost Avoidance Modeling
Design rework cost is modeled as a probability-weighted expected value. Expected Rework Cost =
Probability of Late Change × Cost of Change × Scope Impact Ratio MIYAR reduces probability of
late change by introducing structured validation before design freeze. Cost of Change includes: 
redesign fees  procurement replacement  schedule delay cost  coordination cost  material waste
5. Programme Acceleration Model
Time savings are modeled through decision latency reduction. Decision Compression Value = Days
Saved × Daily Project Carry Cost Daily Carry Cost includes:  financing cost  contractor standby 
overhead burn  lost sales window exposure
6. Specification Optimization Model
Specification optimization measures cost alignment with target market tier. Specification Variance
Cost = |Actual Spec Cost – Optimal Spec Cost| × Quantity MIYAR reduces both over-specification
and under-specification risk.


7. Market Positioning Impact
Interior alignment influences absorption rate and price perception. Economic impact includes: 
reduced discounting  faster sales velocity  price resilience Positioning Value = GDV × Price
Sensitivity Adjustment × Confidence Multiplier
8. Data Inputs Required
The ROI engine requires structured inputs across project definition, interior scope, cost structure,
and timeline. Primary data categories:  project financials  interior package budget  decision
timeline  procurement structure  market positioning tier  financing structure
9. Output Structure
ROI reporting generates three layers of output: Executive Summary Financial Breakdown Tables
Sensitivity Analysis Scenarios Outputs include both conservative and projected value ranges.
10. Calibration Methodology
The economic model improves continuously through post-project tracking. Calibration sources: 
actual change orders  procurement variance  schedule deviation  sales performance Parameters
are updated using weighted rolling datasets.
11. Risk Adjustment Framework
All ROI outputs include confidence intervals. Adjustment factors:  project complexity  developer
experience level  procurement fragmentation  market volatility
12. Sensitivity Analysis Engine
The model simulates value under variable conditions. Scenario dimensions:  high volatility
procurement  accelerated programme pressure  premium positioning  cost-sensitive positioning
13. Reporting Integration
ROI outputs integrate directly into MIYAR reporting dashboards and PDF deliverables. Visual
outputs:  waterfall charts  cost impact matrices  risk bands  sensitivity graphs
14. Strategic Role of ROI Engine
The ROI engine is not a marketing device. It is a computational validation mechanism that
quantifies decision quality. It transforms qualitative design alignment into measurable financial logic.
