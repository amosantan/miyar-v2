MIYAR Technical Blueprint — Part 1 System
Architecture & Functional Model
 
1. System Definition Boundary
MIYAR is a decision intelligence system designed to compute validated interior development
direction from structured project inputs under defined financial, market, and strategic constraints.
The system operates strictly within the pre-design phase of real estate development and does not
generate architectural drawings, interior layouts, or regulatory documentation. The system
boundary begins at project definition and ends at validated direction output and decision reports. All
creative execution, technical detailing, and construction documentation occur outside system
scope. System function is computational, not advisory. MIYAR evaluates consistency, feasibility,
positioning alignment, and economic coherence across defined development variables. Primary
system purpose: Transform uncertain design intention into quantified, structured, defensible interior
positioning. Operational domain:  Early-stage development planning  Interior positioning validation
 Cost-direction coherence  Market alignment evaluation  Strategic differentiation testing 
Procurement readiness structuring
2. Core Computational Objective
MIYAR computes validated interior positioning from multi-dimensional development inputs using
weighted evaluation logic to produce structured decision outputs and implementation-ready briefing
intelligence. The system resolves five forms of uncertainty simultaneously: 1. Strategic uncertainty
— whether direction aligns with project intent 2. Financial uncertainty — whether positioning fits
budget envelope 3. Market uncertainty — whether offering matches buyer expectation 4.
Differentiation uncertainty — whether concept is competitively distinct 5. Execution uncertainty —
whether direction can be consistently implemented The engine does not recommend aesthetic
style. It evaluates viability of proposed or candidate directions under constraint conditions.
3. Functional System Layers
The system is organized into seven functional layers: Layer 1 — Input Acquisition Layer Captures
structured project data across spatial, financial, market, and strategic dimensions. Layer 2 —
Normalization Layer Transforms heterogeneous inputs into standardized computational variables.
Layer 3 — Evaluation Engine Runs deterministic scoring logic across multiple assessment
dimensions. Layer 4 — Scenario Simulation Layer Tests alternative positioning outcomes under
constraint variation. Layer 5 — Synthesis Layer Integrates results into coherent direction validation.
Layer 6 — Reporting Engine Generates structured decision outputs, risk indicators, and briefing
documents. Layer 7 — Administrative Governance Layer Controls weighting models, validation
thresholds, and system evolution. Each layer operates independently but sequentially.
4. System Input Classes
Inputs are organized into five primary data domains: Project Identity Domain  Asset type 
Development scale  Target positioning level  Brand strategy Financial Domain  Budget envelope
 Cost tolerance range  Value engineering constraints Market Domain  Target buyer segment 
Price band  Competitive context Spatial Domain  Unit mix  Area distribution  Amenity
composition Strategic Intent Domain  Differentiation ambition  Design philosophy indicators  Risk
tolerance All inputs are structured. Free text is converted into categorical variables.
5. Evaluation Dimensions


The system evaluates candidate interior direction across core analytical dimensions: Strategic
Alignment Score Financial Compatibility Score Market Fit Score Differentiation Strength Score
Execution Feasibility Score Each dimension is independently computed and later synthesized into
composite direction viability. Dimension independence ensures diagnostic transparency.
6. Decision Logic Structure
MIYAR applies weighted multi-criteria evaluation using constrained scoring models. Each
dimension contains:  Variable set  Weight allocation  Threshold logic  Penalty mechanisms 
Confidence indicators The system uses rule-governed evaluation, not generative inference.
Decision outcomes are determined through threshold satisfaction, not preference ranking.
7. Scenario Simulation Model
The system generates structured alternative outcomes by modifying constraint variables within
defined tolerance bands. Simulation objectives:  Identify sensitivity drivers  Test robustness of
direction  Evaluate upgrade / downgrade positioning  Estimate cost-impact relationships Scenario
outputs are comparative, not predictive.
8. Output Architecture
MIYAR produces three output classes: Validation Outputs  Direction viability classification  Risk
concentration indicators  Alignment diagnostics Decision Structuring Outputs  Positioning
definition  Material level classification  Budget structure guidance Implementation Preparation
Outputs  Design brief foundation  Procurement readiness parameters  Strategic narrative for
marketing alignment Outputs are standardized across all projects.
9. Reporting System
Report generation is deterministic. Every report contains:  Input summary  Evaluation results 
Dimension scoring matrix  Scenario comparisons  Risk interpretation  Implementation
implications Reports are decision artifacts, not descriptive summaries.
10. Administrative Control Framework
Administrative control governs: Weight calibration Threshold modification Model versioning Data
accumulation rules Benchmark formation Administrative authority is restricted to certified system
managers.
11. Data Persistence Architecture
The system stores structured project records, evaluation outcomes, and parameter configurations.
Data classes stored:  Input datasets  Computed scores  Scenario outputs  Model versions 
Benchmark references Persistent storage enables longitudinal comparison and future
benchmarking.
12. Learning and Evolution Model
MIYAR does not self-learn automatically. Model refinement occurs through controlled recalibration
based on accumulated project data. Evolution mechanisms:  Parameter adjustment  Threshold
tuning  Weight redistribution  Benchmark expansion All changes require explicit administrative
validation.


13. System Interaction Model
Users interact through structured workflow stages: Project definition Input submission Direction
candidate selection Evaluation execution Scenario exploration Report generation Export Interaction
is guided and sequential.
14. Technology Positioning
The system integrates deterministic computation with optional AI-assisted classification for
non-structured input interpretation. AI roles are restricted to:  Text normalization  Pattern
categorization  Comparative summarization Core evaluation remains rule-based.
15. System Scalability Logic
Scalability occurs through: Increased project volume Expanded benchmarking database Additional
evaluation modules Regional parameter calibration Core architecture remains constant.
16. Security and Governance
Security structure includes: Project-level data isolation Role-based permissions Encrypted storage
Version tracking Governance ensures auditability of decisions.
17. System Output Utility
Outputs support: Developer decision confirmation Design brief preparation Cost planning alignment
Investor communication Internal approval processes System output replaces informal early-stage
judgment.
18. Functional System Identity
MIYAR is not: A design generator A consulting advisory A visualization platform A budgeting tool
MIYAR is a structured validation engine for interior development direction.
19. System Completion Condition
The system completes processing when validated direction achieves threshold compliance across
required evaluation dimensions. If thresholds are not met, direction is classified as unvalidated.
20. Architecture Integrity Principle
All system behavior must remain deterministic, explainable, and reproducible. No decision may be
generated without traceable variable influence.
