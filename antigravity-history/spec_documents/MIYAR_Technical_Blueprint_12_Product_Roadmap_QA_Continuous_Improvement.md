MIYAR Technical Blueprint 12
 Product Roadmap, Quality Assurance, and Continuous
Improvement Framework
1. Strategic Product Evolution Framework
This document defines how MIYAR evolves over time through structured release cycles, quality
control processes, performance monitoring, and systematic improvement. The objective is to
ensure long-term reliability, scalability, and decision accuracy while maintaining strict governance
over model behaviour and user experience.
1.1 Product Development Phases
Phase
Objective
Core Deliverables
Success Criteria
Phase 1 – Core Validation Engine
Establish functional decision workflow
Input capture, scoring model, reporting engine
Accurate decision outputs across pilot projects
Phase 2 – Structured Data Layer
Build repeatable data architecture
Historical dataset repository, benchmarking logic
Consistent cross-project comparability
Phase 3 – Analytical Dashboard
Enable monitoring and interpretation
Interactive visual dashboards and project analytics
Users interpret results without manual analysis
Phase 4 – Predictive Intelligence
Enable forward■looking recommendations
Trend detection and scenario modelling
System predicts risk before design commitment
Phase 5 – Adaptive Learning System
Automated improvement cycle
Model retraining and performance optimisation
Measured improvement in decision accuracy
2. Quality Assurance Architecture
MIYAR operates as a decision■critical system. Therefore, validation of functionality, outputs, and
user interaction is implemented across multiple testing layers.
