MIYAR Technical Blueprint 24
 Human–AI Collaboration, Decision Override &
Control Architecture
1. System Purpose
This blueprint defines how human expertise interacts with the MIYAR computational decision
system. The platform is intentionally designed as a human■supervised intelligence environment
rather than a fully autonomous decision authority. The objective is to ensure that strategic,
contextual, and experiential judgment remains embedded in final development decisions while
computational logic provides structured analytical support.
2. Human–AI Collaboration Model
Layer
Human Role
System Role
Input Structuring
Define strategic intent and contextual constraints
Standardize data representation
Evaluation Phase
Review model scoring and diagnostics
Compute multi-variable analysis
Interpretation
Assess strategic suitability
Provide explanation layers
Decision Finalization
Approve, modify, or override outputs
Record decision pathway
Learning Feedback
Provide post-decision evaluation
Update learning dataset
3. Decision Override Framework
The system permits structured override of computational recommendations. Overrides are not
treated as errors; they are captured as analytical signals for future learning calibration. Each
override event must include a justification classification to maintain interpretability and governance
integrity.
Override Type
Description
System Response
Strategic Override
Human selects alternative positioning based on vision
Record divergence factor
Market Insight Override
Human introduces new external market signal
Re-weight relevant variables
Risk Adjustment Override
Human adjusts risk tolerance threshold
Recalculate scoring sensitivity
Experimental Override
Human tests unconventional direction
Flag as experimental dataset
4. Decision Authority Hierarchy
1
Level 1 — Computational Recommendation (default analytical output)
2
Level 2 — Assisted Adjustment (human modifies parameters)
3
Level 3 — Structured Override (human selects alternative path)
4
Level 4 — Executive Override (strategic leadership decision)
5
Level 5 — Governance Lock (requires administrative approval)
5. Explainability and Transparency Controls


Explainability Layer
Function
Variable Contribution Map
Displays influence weight of each input
Sensitivity Analysis Panel
Shows outcome response to change
Confidence Distribution
Probability range of recommendation
Decision Trace Log
Chronological decision record
Override Annotation Record
Stores human reasoning
6. Learning Integration from Human Interaction
Human interventions are treated as structured learning signals. The system tracks override
frequency, decision divergence magnitude, and post-outcome performance to refine future
recommendations. Learning adjustments remain bounded by governance constraints to preserve
model stability.
7. Human–System Risk Controls
Risk
Mitigation Mechanism
Over-reliance on automation
Mandatory human confirmation
Inconsistent human overrides
Override justification taxonomy
Model drift from excessive overrides
Threshold-limited learning updates
Strategic bias injection
Multi-level review triggers
Audit failure
Immutable decision logs
8. Strategic System Role
This architecture ensures that MIYAR remains a decision■support intelligence platform rather than
an automated decision authority. By embedding structured human supervision, the system
preserves contextual reasoning, enhances trust, and maintains accountability while still benefiting
from computational analytical power.
