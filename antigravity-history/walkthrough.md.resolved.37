## Phase A.3 — Evidence Chain Click-Through

### What Was Built

**Goal:** Let investors click any cost number and trace it back to a named, dated, graded source.

| Layer | File | What |
|-------|------|------|
| DB | [db.ts](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/db.ts) | [getEvidenceWithSources()](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/db.ts#2172-2220) — JOIN evidence_records + source_registry |
| API | [design.ts](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/routers/design.ts) | `design.getEvidenceChain` query endpoint |
| Component | [EvidenceChainDrawer.tsx](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/client/src/components/EvidenceChainDrawer.tsx) | 230-line slide-out Sheet with full provenance cards |
| Integration | [BriefEditor.tsx](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/client/src/pages/BriefEditor.tsx) | 📎 on every AED/m² badge |
| Integration | [InvestorSummary.tsx](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/client/src/pages/InvestorSummary.tsx) | "📎 View Evidence Chain" on Section B header |

### Each Evidence Card Shows

1. **Item name** + spec class
2. **Reliability grade** badge (A = green, B = amber, C = red)
3. **Price range grid**: Low / Typical / High in AED
4. **Extracted evidence snippet** (the raw text from the source)
5. **Source provenance**: name, type, URL link, freshness indicator
6. **Record ID + capture date**

### Verification

- `vite build` ✅ (6.06s)
- Pushed to main `37ff78b`

## Key Audit Finding

**Phase A.1 (Ask MIYAR NL Query) and A.2 (Stress Test Visualization) were already fully built.** The Dashboard has a working search bar wired to [nl-engine.ts](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/engines/autonomous/nl-engine.ts) (Text→SQL→Execute→Interpret pipeline), and the Scenarios page has stress test mutations with resilience scores. Both were skipped as already complete.

## Phase A.4 — Data Freshness Badges

### What Was Built

**Goal:** Show investors at a glance whether market data is current, aging, or stale.

| Layer | File | What |
|-------|------|------|
| DB | [db.ts](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/db.ts) | [getConnectorHealthSummary()](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/db.ts#1731-1741) + [getIngestionRunHistory()](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/db.ts#1752-1759) (both pre-existing) |
| API | [design.ts](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/routers/design.ts) | `design.getDataFreshness` endpoint — overall health + per-source freshness |
| Component | [DataFreshnessBanner.tsx](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/client/src/components/DataFreshnessBanner.tsx) | 200-line expandable banner with dot indicators |
| Integration | [Dashboard.tsx](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx) | Compact strip between header and Ask MIYAR |
| Integration | [BriefEditor.tsx](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/client/src/pages/BriefEditor.tsx) | Sidebar below UAE Market Constants title |
| Integration | [InvestorSummary.tsx](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/client/src/pages/InvestorSummary.tsx) | Expanded view in Section E (Market Intelligence) |

### Freshness Indicators

- 🟢 **Fresh** (≤7 days) — data updated within the last week
- 🟡 **Aging** (8–30 days) — data still usable but getting old
- 🔴 **Stale** (>30 days) — data needs refresh, investor should be aware

### Verification

- `vite build` ✅ (6.09s)
- Pushed to main `e0ae186`

## Phase A Summary

| Phase A Item | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| A.1 Ask MIYAR NL Query | ✅ Already built (Dashboard search bar) |
| A.2 Stress Test Visualization | ✅ Already built (Scenarios page) |
| A.3 Evidence Chain Click-Through | ✅ Built this session (`37ff78b`) |

**Phase A is complete.** All "Wire What We Have" items are done.

## Next Steps

- **Phase B.2:** Connector health dashboard (surface connector_health)
- **Phase B.3:** DLD (Dubai Pulse) API connector
