# NotebookLM Resource Hunting Prompts 🎯

We need to fill some critical gaps in the MIYAR database, specifically around **competitor intelligence, precise construction material costs, and future supply projections** in the UAE. 

Since NotebookLM relies on the resources we provide it, **please copy and paste the prompts below into a web-connected AI (like Perplexity, ChatGPT Plus, or Google Gemini)**. This will help you find the best PDF reports and web links to upload to your NotebookLM.

### Prompt 1: Competitor Intelligence & Project Specs
**Copy this to your AI search tool:**
> "Find the most recent (2024-2025) detailed market reports, investor presentations, and project launch brochures for top UAE real estate developers: Emaar, DAMAC, Sobha, Aldar, and OMNIYAT. I am specifically looking for documents that detail their high-end and ultra-luxury project specifications, unit mix, pricing per square foot, and interior amenities. Please provide direct links to PDFs, investor relations documents, or comprehensive web articles that I can download."

### Prompt 2: Construction Cost Benchmarks & Material Pricing
**Copy this to your AI search tool:**
> "Search for reputable 2024 and 2025 construction cost benchmarking reports for the UAE and Dubai (such as those from Turner & Townsend, JLL, CBRE, or Currie & Brown). I need data that breaks down the cost per square meter/foot by asset class (high-rise residential, luxury villas, commercial) and variations based on material quality (standard vs. luxury finishes). Please provide direct links to the PDF reports."

### Prompt 3: Buyer Preferences & Premium Trends (HNWI)
**Copy this to your AI search tool:**
> "Find reports on High-Net-Worth Individual (HNWI) luxury real estate buyer preferences in the UAE for 2024-2025 (e.g., from Knight Frank, Savills, or local luxury brokerages). I need documents that discuss what specific features buyers are paying premiums for, such as biophilic design, smart home tech, branded residences, and specific high-end materials. Provide direct links to PDFs or in-depth articles."
