# MIYAR Future Phases Roadmap

Based on the [Master Plan Gap Analysis](file:///Users/amrosaleh/.gemini/antigravity/brain/7c19b7ce-bcbf-4927-9935-14273b999ad2/master_plan_gap_analysis.md), here is a strategic proposal for the next sequential development phases of MIYAR. This progression ensures we build on our current capabilities incrementally, increasing the platform's sophistication and commercial value.

> [!TIP]
> This is a proposed sequence. Phases can be re-ordered depending on immediate commercial priorities or client demands.

## Phase V9: Strategic Risk & Economic Modeling
**Relevant Blueprints: BP 17, BP 21, BP 35**
*Focus: Deepening the financial and risk layers to move beyond simple budget validation into full Return on Investment (ROI) and macro-economic stress testing.*

- **Programme Acceleration Model (BP 17):** Quantify the financial value of time saved during procurement and execution.
- **Cost Avoidance Modeling (BP 17):** Calculate hard capital saved by early detection of specification errors.
- **Macro-Economic Stress Testing (BP 35):** Implement the `R = (P × I × V) / C` risk scoring model. Simulate supply chain disruptions, material inflation spikes, and labor shortages to test project resilience.
- **Advanced Scenario Ranking (BP 21):** Create comparative algorithms that rank multiple saved scenarios based on risk-adjusted returns, rather than just side-by-side viewing.

## Phase V10: Portfolio Intelligence Optimization
**Relevant Blueprints: BP 22**
*Focus: Scaling the platform's utility from single-asset validation to multi-asset aggregation and capital allocation.*

- **Fleet Aggregation:** Allow developers to group 10+ projects into a distinct "Portfolio" entity.
- **Capital Allocation Optimizer:** Mathematically balance high-yield/high-risk developments with stable, low-risk cash-flow assets across the portfolio.
- **Cross-Project Sensitivity:** Identify systemic vulnerabilities. For example, if 80% of the portfolio heavily relies on ultra-luxury imported marble, flag the aggregated supply chain risk.

---

## Phase V11: Behavioral Decision & Cognitive Bias Framework
**Relevant Blueprints: BP 26**
*Focus: Elevating MIYAR from a passive calculator to an active cognitive partner that protects users from their own psychological biases.*

- **Optimism Detectors:** Flag scenarios where users pair "Ultra-Luxury" aspirations with constrained budgets or impossible execution timelines.
- **Anchoring Alerts:** Detect when users stubbornly hold onto an initial arbitrary budget despite glaring market intelligence to the contrary.
- **Intervention Reports:** Generate specific output summaries highlighting these identified biases, effectively stating: "The math indicates you are being overly optimistic about procurement delivery speed given your selected supplier tiers."

---

## Phase V12: Customer Success Lifecycle Intelligence
**Relevant Blueprints: BP 34**
*Focus: Building an internal, administrative command center to monitor tenant health, drive retention, and prevent churn.*

- **Client Health Scoring:** Calculate scores based on login frequency, number of validations run, reliance on manual overrides (ignoring the AI), and outcome variance.
- **Automated Intervention Triggers:** Alert the MIYAR success team when a high-value enterprise client exhibits behavior typical of impending churn (e.g., stopping scenario simulations).
- **Quantified Value Realization:** Automatically generate quarterly reports for clients stating exactly how much money/time MIYAR saved them.

---

## Phase V13: Digital Twin & Sustainability Simulation
**Relevant Blueprints: BP 29**
*Focus: Introducing real-world spatial effects and sustainability scoring tightly coupled with material selection.*

- **Material-to-Environment Linkage:** Connect specific material selections (from the V8 Finish Schedule) to their physical thermal or acoustic properties.
- **Sustainability/Green Scoring:** Evaluate the projected energy efficiency or carbon footprint of the selected design brief.
- **Dynamic Feedback Loop:** If a user selects cheaper single-pane glass, immediately show the detrimental impact on the sustainability score and long-term operational costs.

### Discussion Question
Which of these phases aligns closest with your immediate business objectives? 
- If the goal is targeting **C-Suite executives and CFOs**, V9 and V10 are the most powerful.
- If the goal is **product differentiation and AI defensibility**, V11 (Cognitive Bias) is highly unique.
- If the goal is **operational scaling and revenue protection**, V12 (Customer Success) is critical.
