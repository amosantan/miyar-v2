# MIYAR UI Redesign — Premium Interior Design Experience

## Goal

Transform MIYAR from a functional dark-themed dashboard into a **premium interior design intelligence platform** that feels like a luxury hotel lobby meets a Bloomberg terminal. Update the pre-login homepage to showcase real app capabilities and add a version changelog. Streamline the dashboard sidebar for easier navigation.
