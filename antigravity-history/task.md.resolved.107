# DLD Transaction & Rent Integration — Research and Planning

## Phase 1: Research & Analysis
- [x] Research real estate analytics calculation methods (AED/sqft, yield, fitout ratios)
- [x] Full codebase scan: identify all integration points
- [x] Create implementation plan with calculations + integration map

## Phase 2: Schema & Ingestion (after user provides JSON files)
- [/] Create `dld_transactions` table
- [/] Create `dld_rents` table
- [ ] Build ingestion scripts for both datasets (blocked on JSON files)

## Phase 3: Calculation Engine
- [/] Build DLD analytics engine (median/avg price per area, yield calc, fitout ratio)
- [ ] Wire calculations into existing benchmarkData
- [/] Integrate with scoring engine (FF, DS, MP dimensions)

## Phase 4: UI Integration
- [ ] Area comparison panel with real transaction benchmarks
- [ ] Investor Summary with real market comps
- [ ] Design Brief with fitout calibration recommendations
- [ ] Over-specification warnings in project evaluation
