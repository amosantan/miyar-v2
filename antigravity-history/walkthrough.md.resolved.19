# Phase C Walkthrough: Portfolio Feature

## Summary
Implemented the Portfolio management feature for MIYAR — from database schema through full-stack CRUD to a user-facing page accessible at `/portfolio`.

## Changes Made

### C1: Schema Tables
- Added `portfolios` table (id, name, description, organization_id, created_by, timestamps)
- Added `portfolio_projects` junction table (portfolio_id, project_id, note, added_at)
- Migration applied via `drizzle-kit push`

### C2+C3: Portfolio Engine & CRUD Router
- Created [portfolio.ts](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/routers/portfolio.ts) with 8 endpoints:
  - [list](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/db.ts#1559-1569) — all org portfolios with project count + avg score/risk
  - `getById` — full detail with analytics (distributions, heatmap, failure patterns, improvement levers)
  - [create](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/db.ts#161-167) / [update](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/db.ts#193-198) / [delete](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/db.ts#199-204) — standard CRUD
  - `addProject` / `removeProject` — manage portfolio membership
  - `availableProjects` — projects not yet in a portfolio
- Registered in [routers.ts](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/routers.ts) as `portfolio`

### C4: Portfolio Page
- Created [PortfolioPage.tsx](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/client/src/pages/PortfolioPage.tsx):
  - **List View**: Portfolio cards with project count, avg score, delete. Create dialog.
  - **Detail View**: Project table with scores, add/remove projects, failure patterns, improvement levers, score distributions.
- Added route `/portfolio` in [App.tsx](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/client/src/App.tsx)
- Added sidebar nav link in [DashboardLayout.tsx](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/client/src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx) under Analysis section

## Verification
- TypeScript compilation: ✅ No new errors (all existing errors are pre-existing in unrelated files)
- Schema migration: ✅ `drizzle-kit push` applied cleanly
- All lint errors in portfolio router fixed

## Remaining (C5, C6)
- **C5**: Portfolio-level PDF report generation
- **C6**: Portfolio alerts wired to alert engine
