# Priority 4: Post-Mortem / Outcome Learning Engine

## What Changed

Built the feedback loop that connects MIYAR's **predictions** to **reality**, enabling the system to track its own accuracy and generate self-correcting evidence.

### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| [db.ts](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/db.ts) | Updated [createProjectOutcome()](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/db.ts#1147-1170) to accept V5 fields |
| [post-mortem-evidence.ts](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/engines/learning/post-mortem-evidence.ts) | **[NEW]** [generatePostMortemEvidence()](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/engines/learning/post-mortem-evidence.ts#28-143) + [summarizeLearningSignals()](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/engines/learning/post-mortem-evidence.ts#144-189) |
| [learning.ts](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/routers/learning.ts) | Added `submitPostMortem` + `getPostMortemStatus` |

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Auto-comparison on submit** — when a post-mortem is submitted, the comparison engine runs immediately (no manual step)
2. **Evidence generation** — cost deltas >5%, risk mispredictions, and score misses each produce tagged evidence records at `handover` phase

### Notebook Name: **MIYAR UAE Market Intelligence & Design**
- Topics Extracted: UAE Real Estate Market Dynamics, Construction Costs, Sustainable Building, Luxury Interior Design Trends, Procurement.
- Use Cases: Real Estate Investment & Strategy, Project Budgeting & Execution Planning.

### 4. Database Enrichment via NotebookLM Insights 🧠

Leveraged the newly integrated NotebookLM library to extract structured, actionable market intelligence, which was immediately seeded into the application database:

#### Luxury Interior Design & Construction Trends (Inserted into `trend_tags`)
10 high-value UAE market trends were extracted and mapped to the exact database schema:
- **Biophilic Design** (design_trend)
- **AI-Powered Smart Homes** (technology)
- **Ultra-Rare Marble** (material_trend)
- **Wellness-Centric Layouts** (design_trend)
- **Desert-Inspired Minimalism** (design_trend)
- **Sustainable Luxury** (sustainability)
- **Sensory-Rich Textures** (material_trend)
- **Sculptural Lighting** (design_trend)
- **Dual-Zone Kitchens** (design_trend)
- **Contemporary Arabian Opulence** (design_trend)

#### Construction Cost Benchmarks (Inserted into `benchmark_data`)
5 highly realistic 2025-2026 UAE construction cost benchmarks were seeded:
- **Residential Villa (Mid-Tier):** 300 - 500 AED/sqft (Standard Materials)
- **Residential Villa (Luxury):** 900 - 1400 AED/sqft (Luxury Materials)
- **Residential High Rise (Mid-Tier):** 350 - 700 AED/sqft (Standard Materials)
- **Commercial (Premium):** 510 - 680 AED/sqft (Premium Materials)
- **Commercial (Ultra Luxury):** 850 - 1500 AED/sqft (Luxury Materials)

#### Phase 2: Competitor Intel & HNWI Preferences (Inserted into `competitor_projects` & `trend_tags`)
Following the addition of new PDF reports and market resources by the user, a second extraction phase was executed:
- **5 High-Net-Worth Individual (HNWI) Buyer Preferences** extracted and seeded as `trend_tags` (e.g., Branded Residences, Family-Sized Beachfront Villas, Integrated Wellness Facilities).
- **Competitor Intelligence for 5 Top Developers** extracted:
  - **Emaar** (Avg: 4134 AED/sqft; Focus: Nature-washed luxury, equestrian heritage, championship golf courses)
  - **DAMAC** (Avg: 4053 AED/sqft; Focus: High-fashion branded partnerships, floating cinemas, wave simulators)
  - **Sobha** (Avg: 3247 AED/sqft; Focus: Backward integration, bespoke bespoke interiors, green estates)
  - **Aldar** (Avg: 2960 AED/sqft; Focus: Urban modern luxury, smart access, rooftop pools)
  - **OMNIYAT** (Avg: 7695 AED/sqft; Focus: Ultra-rare materials like Black Zebra marble, Dorchester Collection management)
  - *These competitor insights were seeded directly into `competitor_projects` to act as foundational market data for the Master Plan gap analysis engine.*

*(Note: Granular material pricing by tier was postponed due to context limits and will be handled via the Analytics module in future iterations).*

## Next Steps

3. **Non-fatal comparison** — if no score matrix exists yet, the outcome still saves; comparison runs later via `runComparison`
4. **"No automatic learning without validation"** — deltas are logged as evidence; benchmark/weight adjustments still require human approval through existing `getPendingBenchmarkSuggestions`

### Existing Infrastructure Leveraged

The majority of the backend was already built:
- `project_outcomes` table with V5 schema ✅
- `outcome_comparisons` table with accuracy grading ✅
- [compareOutcomeToPrediction()](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/server/engines/learning/outcome-comparator.ts#53-220) engine ✅
- `runComparison` mutation ✅

We only needed to fill three gaps: DB function signature, evidence generation, and the entry-point mutation.

## Verification

- **655 tests pass**, 27 pre-existing failures, **0 regressions**
- Committed: `665a0dc` → pushed to [main](file:///Users/amrosaleh/Maiyar/miyar-v2/scripts/seed-notebook-insights.ts#20-115)
