# MIYAR Master Target Roadmap: From Feasibility to Value Creation

Based on our recent discussions, the ultimate goal for MIYAR is to become the definitive "realistic decision-making tool" for UAE developers and interior designers. It must dictate the right design decisions (cost, material, design style) and definitively predict how those decisions will impact the execution timeline, the sales velocity, and the brand equity of the developer.

Having completed Phase 7 (Deep Analytics), MIYAR is now exceptionally smart at validating budgets and scoring projects against risk. To reach the ultimate target, we need to bridge the gap between *financial modeling* and *physical execution & sales*.

Here is a proposed multi-stage roadmap to reach this target app state.

## 🏗️ Phase 8: Real-World Procurement & Material Intelligence
*Goal: Move from generic benchmark categories (e.g., "Premium Flooring (300 AED/sqm)") to specifying precise, supplier-backed materials.*
1. **Live Supplier Catalogs:** Ingest live UAE supplier prices (e.g., Cosentino, RAK Ceramics, Grohe) into the database.
2. **Automated Vendor Matching:** When a user selects "Strict Vendor List" and a "Premium" tier, automatically build a BoQ (Bill of Quantities) utilizing exact suppliers, highlighting their lead times and real-world costs.
3. **Carbon & Maintenance Profiling:** Add hard numbers for the maintenance costs (OPEX) and embedded carbon footprints of each physical material to justify "Lifecycle Focus" decisions.

## 🎨 Phase 9: AI Design Visualization (The "Sales Asset")
*Goal: Let the user (and investors) actually SEE the data-backed design, speeding up sales and board approvals.*
1. **Determinant Mood Board Generation:** Instead of generic AI images, use Gemini and Image APIs to generate hyper-realistic room renders that strictly adhere to the exact materials selected in Phase 8 and the defined "Brand Standards" from Phase 6.
2. **Space Planning & Ratios:** Evaluate floor plans to advise on spatial psychology (e.g., "Increasing the master suite size by 15% historically increases sales price by 8% in Business Bay").

## 📈 Phase 10: The Sales Premium & Yield Predictor Engine
*Goal: Prove to developers that investing in higher quality design directly pays off in the final sale or rental yield.*
1. **DLD (Dubai Land Department) Live Integration:** Cross-reference the project's design score against live neighborhood transaction data.
2. **Value-Add Calculation Engine:** Create dynamic ROI bridges showing exact formulas, e.g., "If you invest +500 AED/sqm into 'Fully Furnished' interiors, your target rental yield increases from 6.5% to 8.2% based on comparable properties."
3. **Brand-Equity Forecasting:** Help "Trophy Assets" mathematically justify their elastic budgets by analyzing how a halo-effect boosts the developer's entire portfolio valuation.

## 🚀 Phase 11: Developer Portfolio Optimization & Fleet Tracking
*Goal: Scale the intelligence from individual projects to a developer’s entire pipeline.*
1. **Cross-Project Aggregation:** Combine 10+ projects into a single dashboard.
2. **Systemic Vulnerability Alerts:** Expose supply chain risks at scale (e.g., "5 of your projects require ultra-luxury Italian marble next quarter; consolidate procurement immediately to mitigate a 15% shipping premium").
3. **Execution Tracking:** Transition projects from "Planning" to "Execution," ingesting real-world invoices to continuously self-correct the MIYAR benchmark data based on reality.

## 🧠 Phase 12: Cognitive Bias & Decision Guardrails
*Goal: Protect users from their own optimism.*
1. **Anchoring & Optimism Alerts:** If a user demands an "Ultra-Luxury" finish on an economy budget or with "Zero Flexibility" timelines, strictly flag the decision with data-backed severity levels.
2. **Automated Strategy Adjustments:** Before letting the developer export an impossible brief, the AI intervenes with 3 balanced compromise scenarios (e.g., "Sacrifice Timeline," "Downgrade Material," or "Increase Budget").

### Questions to Calibrate Priority

To determine what we start building *tomorrow*, I have a few strategic questions:

1. **Procurement vs. Sales Velocity:** What is the bigger pain point right now? Trying to find the exact *real materials and suppliers* (Phase 8), or trying to prove to investors that a design will generate a *higher sale price/ROI* (Phase 10)?
2. **Visuals vs. Spreadsheets:** Should the next immediate feature be focused on AI-generated **mood boards and space renders** (Phase 9) to wow investors, or on hard **procurement lists and RFQs** (Phase 8) for the contractors?
3. **Real-Time Data Feed vs. Static Intel:** How deeply do we want to integrate with external systems right now? For example, pulling live Dubai real estate transaction data automatically, or keeping the system closed with our manually curated intelligence for now?
